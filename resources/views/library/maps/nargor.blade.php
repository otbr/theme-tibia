                    Nargor, the second largest of the Shattered isles, is situated in the South West. Massive, jagged mountains and cliffs cover the entire landmass. Sharp reefs around Nargor are a real hazard to every ship that tries to reach the coast. The only ones who master the dangerous seaway are fierce pirates. They have founded a perfect hideout on this island that is marked by countless caves, tunnels and grottos. Their main base is a huge grotto at the southern side whose entrance is even large enough to steer a ship inside.
